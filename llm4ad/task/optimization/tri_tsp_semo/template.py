task_description = "You are solving a Tri-objective Travelling Salesman Problem (tri-TSP), where each node has three different 2D coordinates: \
(x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), representing its position in three objective spaces. The goal is to find a tour visiting each node exactly once and returning \
to the starting node, while minimizing three objectives simultaneously: the total tour length in each coordinate space. \
Given an archive of non-dominated solutions, where each solution is a numpy array representing a TSP tour, and its corresponding objective \
is a tuple of three values (cost in each space), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive \
and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it. \
Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, \
i.e., the solution must represent a valid TSP tour: it visits each node exactly once, ensuring no node is skipped or revisited. \
Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement.\
Using a creative local search strategy of your own design, specifically tailored to effectively optimize across three objectives, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution."
